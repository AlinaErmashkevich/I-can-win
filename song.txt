If the night turned cold
And the stars looked down
And you hug yourself
On the cold, cold ground
You wake the morning
In a stranger's coat
No one would you see
Ask yourself, 'Who'd watch for me?
'My only friend, who could it be?'
It's hard to say it
I hate to say it
But it's probably me

When your belly's empty
And the hunger's so real
And you're too proud to beg
And too dumb to steal
You search the city
For your only friend
No-one would you see

You ask yourself, 'Who could it be?
'A solitary voice to speak out and set me free'
I hate to say it
I hate to say it
But it's probably me
